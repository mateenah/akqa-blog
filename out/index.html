The Stena Metall Group drives development throughout the business areas and geographic markets in which we operate. It is not only because we are at the forefront of modern, efficient recycling technology that we have achieved this position. A large part of our business success is due to the way we act according to our business principles and in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. This is expressed in our Code of Conduct.

Dan Sten Olsson, owner of the Stena Metall Group, says: &quot;Every day, our customers, employees, suppliers, financiers, and other stakeholders, as well as society as a whole, expects us to fulfill our promises and the expectations we have directly or indirectly given them. The world invests in us because we are investing in it. In the end, we live in a partnership whose productivity is determined by the trust we earn.&quot;

The Code of Conduct provides guidelines for how we relate to customers and other partners, employees and the environment. It also determines our policies on human rights and corporate responsibility.</p><img src="//images.ctfassets.net/ig0j56pj0q4k/6wImIVmcTQtCAxr0mQk07K/c1cae8cfbf01e67b90c7141422440fef/1280x400_sustainability_ourcodeofconduct_compqual80.jpg" class="jsx-366812611 card-link"/><p class="jsx-366812611 card-subtitle text-muted"></p></div></div></div><div class="jsx-366812611 col-md-4 mb-3 card-box"><div class="jsx-366812611 card text-white bg-primary mb-3"><div class="jsx-366812611 card-title"><h3 class="jsx-366812611">SWEDEN&#x27;S MOST SUSTAINABLE BRAND IN 2018!</h3></div><div class="jsx-366812611 card-body"><h5 class="jsx-366812611 card-subtitle text-muted">swedens-2018</h5></div><div class="jsx-366812611 card-body"><p class="jsx-366812611 card-text">Stena Recycling has been named Sweden&#x27;s most sustainable brand for 2018.

In the 2016/2017 financial year, focus has increased on getting more involved in customers’ value chains. In order to achieve this, several new services have been introduced. Stena Recycling in Sweden has set-up its new Sustainable Business department in order to support customers’ sustainability projects. In collaboration with customers, waste management is optimized by realizing previously hidden value. This reduces waste, improves working conditions, saves time, frees up space and increases the overall value of their waste. The Design for Recycling service offers disassembly analyzes and advice on how to make products more easily recyclable in the design and construction phases.
