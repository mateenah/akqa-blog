In the 2016/2017 financial year, focus has increased on getting more involved in customers’ value chains. In order to achieve this, several new services have been introduced. Stena Recycling in Sweden has set-up its new Sustainable Business department in order to support customers’ sustainability projects. In collaboration with customers, waste management is optimized by realizing previously hidden value. This reduces waste, improves working conditions, saves time, frees up space and increases the overall value of their waste. The Design for Recycling service offers disassembly analyzes and advice on how to make products more easily recyclable in the design and construction phases.
